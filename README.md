# Fraud Detection MLOps Pipeline

## Project Overview
This MLOps project implements a self-healing fraud detection system using machine learning, demonstrating automated data processing, model training, deployment, and monitoring.

## Key Features
- Automated data ingestion and preprocessing
- Machine learning model for fraud detection
- Self-healing pipeline with AI-driven error analysis
- Continuous monitoring and retraining
- Scalable cloud-native deployment

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up cloud credentials for AWS
3. Configure Kubernetes and Airflow
4. Run initialization scripts

## Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize the project
python scripts/initialize_pipeline.py

# Run data preprocessing
airflow dags trigger preprocessing_dag

# Train initial model
python scripts/model_training.py
```
